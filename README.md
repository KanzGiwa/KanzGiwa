## 🎯 Featured Project: [Allstate - Machine Learning Risk Modeling](https://github.com/KanzGiwa/Allstate-1A)  
**What I Did:** Partnered with Allstate to develop a machine learning model that predicts auto insurance claim severity using historical claims data. Led feature engineering, model training, dataset documentation, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Collaborated with teammates to iterate across multiple model architectures and improve predictive performance.
**Tools:** Python, XGBoost, LightGBM, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Google Colab, Google Drive 
**Result:** Reduced Mean Absolute Error by 40% (from baseline 1978 MAE to 1182 MAE), demonstrating more accurate loss predictions. Enabled faster and data-driven claim assessment, helping inform better risk assessment and pricing strategies for insurers.
